In the second, the player can make the character jump off the ground. In both types of game you can set the game mode, which is what the player needs to do to complete the game. In time mode, you set the duration of the game; the player will need to last that whole period to win. In distance mode, you set how far the player will need to travel to win. In survival mode, the game gets harder as it goes along because hazards appear more frequently. And you can set how much harder the game will get as it progresses.",

The player has to identify the word(s) that match the starting word in some way and catch them as they pass on the screen. This will win the player points but catching or bumping into any wrong words will lose the player points. You can include more than one match in your game.
