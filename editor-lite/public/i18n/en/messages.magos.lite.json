Additionally, you can select one of three possible game modes. 1) In time mode you should define how long the game lasts. 2) In survival mode define how rapidly the game gets harder (speeds up the interval between hazards). 3) In distance mode you should define how far the player should be able to travel. If the player achieves enough meters he wins the game.",
